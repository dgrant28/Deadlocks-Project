# Deadlocks-Project

This project utilizes the dining philosophers problem which is a metaphor that illustrates the problem of deadlock. The scenario consists of a group of philosophers sharing a meal at a round table. As philosophers, they like to take some time to think; but they are at a meal, so they also need to eat.
